# PackMap

## Project Description

Have you ever had a problem of what to eat or where to go with a group of friends? Do you all try to use your phone to figure out where to go and everyone is throwing out suggestions but no one is deciding on anywhere? That’s where our app, PackMap, can help. In the app, you can form a pack of your friends and figure out where to go with the help of synchronized maps and voting. Essentially members of a pack pick places that then appears on the map so everyone can stay up-to-date on the current possible choices. You and your friends can then vote on chosen places so everyone knows each others’ preferences. This app can keep all the decision-making process in one central app, as well as making it easier for all friends to contribute.
